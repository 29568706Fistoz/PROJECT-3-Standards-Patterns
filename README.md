# Project Description
#### Project 3: Implementing coding principles and design patterns

# Overview
 In this day and age, there are millions of applications that have been created and are widely used. A developer’s ability to read and understand code is even more important than their ability to write code. As such, I was given an existing ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application that needed to be enhanced and improved. 
As part of this project, I was expected to understand architectural patterns as well as pay specific attention to implementing coding principles and design patterns – aligning with the requirements of the project. 

# GitHub Administration
### Create and Configure GitHub Repository:
- Created a repository named ‘CMPG 323 Project 3 - 29568706
- Created a ReadME.md file that will be used to describe my project and how stakeholders are to use the report that I have developed
### Project Progress:
- I ensured that the solution has been committed and pushed to source control throughout the project
- I ensured that the GitHub project has been updated iteratively throughout the project to demonstrate how progress was made
