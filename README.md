# Project Description

# Overview
- [ ] In this day and age, there are millions of applications that have been created and are widely used. A developer’s ability to read and understand code is even more important than their ability to write code. As such, I was given an existing ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application that needed to be enhanced and improved. 
As part of this project, I was expected to understand architectural patterns as well as pay specific attention to implementing coding principles and design patterns – aligning with the requirements of the project.
